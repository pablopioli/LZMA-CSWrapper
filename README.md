This is a Net library to compress and decompress data in the LZMA format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm).

The official SDK is provided in the C# language (https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html) wich is great!. But it can be simpler to use.

 So I downloaded the helper code from Peter Bromberg (http://www.nullskull.com/a/768/7zip-lzma-inmemory-compression-with-c.aspx), mixed it with the SDK code and made a Net Standard 2 library for a more productive experience.

 Available on nuget.org as LZMA-CSWrapper.
